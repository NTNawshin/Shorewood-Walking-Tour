It was installed by Stormwater Solutions Engineering as part of an Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District project in 2018. Water from the downspout sills into planting containers where special soils filter the water as plants absorb contaminants. It can store over 6 rain barrels worth of rainwater (300 gallons), filtering it before it overflows. An additional unit can be found on the west side of the Village Center. These devices can be installed in your yard, too! Now turn right from the corner and keep walking along East Shorewood Bloulevard following the map.",stop8.png

The village is an optimal location for freshwater enthusiasts! It is bordered by two major bodies of water, the Milwaukee River and Lake Michigan, but unfortunately, that access comes at a cost. Pollution and flooding both present a problem in urban areas with numerous impervious surfaces. Therefore, the Village has adopted several practices, similar to the one you just observed at the first stop, to reduce the amount of pollution by runoff and to effectively manage stormwater issues. At  the end of the street, be sure to cross carefully and turn right on North Oakland Avenue.",stop3.png

You'll see the biofiltration structures on the sidewalk that were installed in 2010 to capture stormwater from rain events and snow melts. Flow enters the structure, passing through engineered soils and native vegetation which filters out pollutants before the water goes to the storm sewers. There are five notable sites for these structures on Capitol Drive, you'll see three of them as you walk. The first one you see on the corner of Oakland and Capitol contains new england and alma potschke aster, karl foerster feather reed grass, and heavy metal switchgrass. Keep going.",stop7.png
