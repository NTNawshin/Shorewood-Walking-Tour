1,"0","Welcome to Green Shorewood!","00_StartingPoint.mp3",43.087840,-87.88449,"<p>Hello, and welcome to our <b>Green Stormwater Infrastructure Walking Tour</b> in the Village of Shorewood in Milwaukee County. You should be standing in the <b>Shorewood Public Library atrium</b>. Refer to Image #1 and #2 of the Starting Point image carousel to confirm you are in the correct location. You can <b>swipe through the images</b> on your screen to view them.
<p>The Village of Shorewood is located between the Milwaukee River on the west and Lake Michigan on the east, with the Library sitting at the midpoint between these watery boundaries. Thus, the Shorewood Public Library serves as a vibrant community hub, offering resources for learning, connection, and exploration, and therefore is a perfect place to start our tour. 
<p><br><b>Navigating the app</b>
<p>Now, let’s dive into the purpose of our tour today. Shorewood’s unique location offers many commercial, recreational, and aesthetic advantages, but also presents a risk: <b>flooding</b> from increasingly frequent and severe storms due to changing climates. To manage stormwater, many cities have built large underground sewers and utility systems, known as <b>Gray Stormwater Infrastructure</b>, which rely on concrete and other unnatural materials to move water away quickly.  
<p>In contrast, the stops on this tour highlight the innovative <b>“green”</b>, or environmentally-friendly, practices that Shorewood has implemented. This collection of practices, known as <b>Green Stormwater Infrastructure</b>, utilizes natural solutions to capture and regulate stormwater right where it falls, alleviating reliance on Gray Stormwater Infrastructure. By doing so, Green Stormwater Infrastructure plays a crucial role in contributing to a more resilient and sustainable Shorewood community.
<p>Today, you will be using an interactive map to follow a green route that will navigate you to 10 stops along the tour. Before starting the tour, make sure that
            <ul>•	Your GPS is enabled on both your phone and browser</ul>
            <ul>•	Your browser screen <b>MUST</b> be open throughout the tour to enable automatic audio playback – do not lock your screen or switch apps</ul>

            <ul>•	And for the best experience, use headphones!</ul>
            </n><b>Most importantly, always watch your step while walking, especially when crossing streets!</b>
<p><br>Now, let’s walk through how the interactive map works. Image #3 shows a static image of the map. You can also find the map and app instructions under the <b>“Menu”</b> tab throughout the tour. If you already feel confident to navigate on your own, you can skip the following explanation and press <b>“Start Tour”</b>, but please make sure you understand how the map and audio features work before heading out.
<p>Once you click the <b>“Start Tour”</b> button, the interactive map will appear on your screen. If <b>GPS is enabled on both your device and browser</b>, you’ll see a <b>blue circle</b> on the map. That’s you! You can refer to your current location on the map to follow the green route. <b>Pinch to zoom out</b> if you'd like an overview of the entire route. The <b>center button</b> re-centers the map to your current location and the button below it turns on <b>dark mode</b>.
<p><b>Follow the numbered green circles on the route to move in the suggested tour direction</b>. These circles represent the 10 main stops, each featuring a different Green Stormwater Infrastructure practice. At each stop, you'll find an audio narration and an image carousel with photos, diagrams, or maps to help you identify and understand the practice. You can also read the text version of the narration on your screen. Use the buttons below the image carousel to <b>adjust Font Size and switch Color Mode for better readability</b>.
<p>For each green circle, please <b>stop walking and listen to the full audio</b> before continuing to the next stop. And <b>always stop walking when viewing text or images for your safety! </b>
<p>The <b>white circles</b> provide additional context as you walk between green stops and thus you can continue to walk while listening to the white circle audio or even skip them if you prefer. 
<p>When you enter any circle on the map, green or white, <b>the audio will play automatically,</b> and the images and text will open up on your screen. It may take a few seconds to load depending on GPS accuracy and internet speed. <b>To avoid delays, we recommend downloading the audio in advance</b>.

<p>If you want to return to this screen, tap <b>“Green Shorewood”</b> at the top or select the <b>first white circle</b> on the map.
<p>The tour should take <b>approximately 2 hours</b> to complete. The route mostly follows paved sidewalks but includes a stairwell and a dirt path along the Milwaukee River. For those who wish to avoid stairs, <b>an alternate accessible route is available</b> near the Oakleaf Trail Bridge on Capitol Drive. This accessible path is mostly paved but includes a 100-foot section of unpaved, slightly sloped trail made of dirt and wood chips. The accessible route is marked with a <b>dashed green line</b> on the map, and I will alert you when you reach the fork so that you can follow your preferred pathway.</p>
<p>Now, click the <b>“Start Tour”</b> button and walk towards the first green circle on the map. If you are facing the library entrance from the atrium, use the door on your left to exit the building. Begin the tour by exploring our first Green Stormwater Infrastructure feature at the northeast corner of the library.</p>",3,14
2,"1","Stop 1: Shorewood Public Library Planter Box","01.0_PlanterBox.mp3",43.087880,-87.883985,"
<p><br>Stop #1 of the tour is at the northeast corner of the Shorewood Public Library near the parking lot entrance from Frederick Avenue. You are looking for an elevated wooden structure that contains various plants. Because of its relatively small size and corner location, it may be easy to miss! To identify our first Green Stormwater Infrastructure practice, look up at the corner of the library building and follow the gutter coming down from the roof. Images #1, #2, and #3 of the Stop #1 carousel show the pathway from the library atrium to Stop #1, although the library grounds might look a little different depending on the season.
<p>The structure you are looking at is called a <b>planter box</b>, and this brand is <b>StormGUARDen</b> spelled “Storm” “G. U. A. R. D.” as in “Guard” and then “e. n.”, providing a bit of play on words.
<p>You might wonder what is so special about a small wooden box? Let me tell you! With a planting area of roughly <b>17 square feet</b>, this StormGUARDen can hold over <b>350 gallons of rainwater</b> during a single rainstorm, which is enough drinking water for an average person for over a year! Quite impressive for such a small feature, right?
<p>Now imagine all that stormwater rushing off the roof, not into this planter, but straight onto the parking lot pavement. Where would the stormwater go?
<p>Did you know that when it rains, urban stormwater often does not soak into the ground? Instead, some of it runs along roofs, driveways, and ultimately into roads, collecting decaying plant debris, lawn chemicals, and pet waste. Gross! This contaminated water then is discharged into nearby water bodies, leading to <b>runoff pollution</b>.   
<p>Planter boxes like StormGUARDen can be installed next to any building with a gutter downspout, including your own home, redirecting stormwater from the roof before it captures any of these harmful pollutants. Planter boxes then allow the stormwater to infiltrate into the ground at a slower speed and at a safe distance from the property’s foundation, preventing runoff pollution into the streets. 
<p>StormGUARDen is a self-watering, durable, and Winter-proof device. The outer wooden box you see is typically made of cedar or treated pine. Image #4 of the Stop #1 carousel provides a diagram of the internal workings of the StormGUARDen planter box in front of you for reference during the following explanation. 
<p>First, runoff water from the roof flows through the downspout into a stone-filled trough. Image #5 in the Stop #1 carousel shows this trough from the backside if vegetation has currently overgrown it. The water then is redirected into the five removable compartments inside that contain specially-engineered soil designed to remove bacteria and pollutants. You can grow a variety of plants in a planter box, hence the “Garden” of StormGUARDen, including the yellow coneflowers shown in Image #6 of the Stop #1 carousel that are native to this region of Wisconsin. The plants further absorb contaminants, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that prevents runoff pollution. In fact, the StormGUARDen system is so efficient at removing pollution, you even can grow fruits and vegetables in this soil to eat! Yum!
<p>Beneath this soil lies a layer of stone for water storage, giving plants access to water during dry weather. Excess water from the compartment overflows into a reservoir. As the reservoir fills, water is slowly released through a set of small outlets and drains. Just like that, the StormGUARDen self-discharges and is ready to take on water from the next storm!
<p>By installing planter boxes like StormGUARDen, property owners can control their stormwater within a small footprint before it causes problems in the local and regional waterways. Moreover, planter boxes are low-maintenance with minimal construction and upkeep expenses.  
<p>As you stand here, take a moment to appreciate the functionality of this StormGUARDen. It is a small yet vital part of a broader network of practices for Green Stormwater Infrastructure that work together to protect our community and environment. Imagine the positive impact you can make by installing one at home! Where would you place it at your house?
<p>A link for obtaining your own StormGUARDen is included under the “Menu” tab.
<p>Now, let’s head back past the library entrance to Murray Avenue. You can go through the atrium again or take the outside stairs to get to the Murray Avenue sidewalk. There also is an accessible ramp to Murray Avenue to the right of the stairs on the north side of the library property.

Do you see any similar planter box structures near the library building? Feel free to pause if you want to have a closer look. Depending on the season, you might be able to spot two more StormGUARDen installations. Otherwise, keep walking until you reach the intersection of Murray Avenue and Shorewood Boulevard and turn right to head west along Shorewood Boulevard. As a reminder, you can refer to the interactive map if you ever need help with directions.",2,13
4,"0","Keep walking","01.2_Walk.mp3",43.087407,-87.885395,"<p><br>As you proceed towards Stop #2, let's dive deeper into the concept of Green Stormwater Infrastructure. As introduced at the start of the tour, Green Stormwater Infrastructure refers to a variety of practices designed to sustainably manage stormwater, which is a major source of flooding and runoff pollution in urban areas.  
<p>Traditionally, communities have used Gray Stormwater Infrastructure, which relies heavily on <b>stormwater sewers</b>, or an interconnected network of <b>ditches</b>, <b>drains</b>, and <b>pipes</b> that move stormwater away from urban areas. However, this approach treats stormwater as a waste rather than a resource, missing opportunities for replenishing local water supplies. As urban areas grow, much of these outdated systems struggle to handle large runoff volumes during heavy rain events. These events ultimately can lead to backups, overflows, and even sewer system failures. 
<p>To address these problems, many communities are adopting a range of practices for Green Stormwater Infrastructure. These structures use natural hydrological processes and materials such as plants, soil, and permeable surfaces to capture, absorb, and treat stormwater and melting snow directly at the source…and often at a lower cost to taxpayers!  
<p>Green Stormwater Infrastructure can take on numerous shapes and sizes, and are placed strategically to maximize their impact. As you walk on this tour, you will see examples at different physical scales, from small planter boxes and rain barrels on individual properties, to bioswales, permeable pavers, and urban gardens in neighborhoods, and even large-scale efforts to protect nature corridors and greenways that span across Milwaukee County. Together, these practices form a network of Green Stormwater Infrastructure that contribute to long-term sustainability of water management and community resilience in the face of changing climates and increasing urbanization!   
<p>As you reach the traffic lights and before you cross the intersection of North Oakland Avenue and Shorewood Boulevard, pause a moment to look at the diagram that is part of this white circle narration. This diagram provides a visual reference for the different kinds of practices for Green Stormwater Infrastructure that you will visit on this tour. You can return to this reference diagram under the “Menu” tab throughout the tour to compare and contrast different Green Stormwater Infrastructure practices at each stop.
<p>Once you are ready, cross North Oakland Avenue to reach Stop #2 on the opposite side of the street.</p>

5,"2","Stop 2: Parking Lot Bioswale","02.0_Bioswale.mp3",43.087465,-87.887689,"<p>
<br>Stop #2 of the tour is on the northwest corner of the North Oakloand Avenue and Shorewood Boulevard intersection just behind the bus stop. Stop in front of the bus stop bench and look behind the bench. Do you see the Shorewood High School parking lot in front of you? To view our next Green Stormwater Infrastructure practice, enter the parking lot and look back towards the bus stop bench. Near the fence by the sidewalk, you will see a gently sloped ditch with plants growing around a metal grate in the center. Images #1 and #2 of the Stop #2 carousel show the bus stop bench from the intersection crossing and then the grate behind the bench from the parking lot to help you confirm your location.   
<p>This structure is called a <b>bioswale</b>, or specifically in this case, a <b>parking lot bioswale</b>, and is designed to capture and filter stormwater runoff from the surrounding parking lot pavement.  
<p>A <b>“swale”</b> means a small, sunken, marshy depression, with the <b>“bio”</b> adding typically native vegetation that helps manage stormwater runoff and increase infiltration. While this feature may seem modest, every foot of a bioswale can process about <b>3 gallons of stormwater</b> during a storm event, keeping stormwater on the landscape. While storm events are growing with increased frequency and severity due to changing climates, the majority of annual precipitation still comes from small rain events, and the runoff from these often can be entirely absorbed by a bioswale!
<p>Relating back to Stop #1, a parking lot somewhat acts like the roof of your house, except at a much larger scale. During rainfall, concrete parking lots funnel stormwater across the large, paved surface into a small set of sewer drains, carrying with it car fluids like motor oil, heavy metals and glass, garbage, and other <b>runoff pollutants</b> found in parking lots. Double gross! This contaminated water clogs the parking lot drains with debris, flooding the streets, and ultimately is discharged into nearby water bodies, again leading to downstream flooding and runoff pollution.
<p>Luckily, a bioswale acts much like a planter box for your roof, but meets the larger scale of the parking lot! Image #3 of the Stop #2 carousel provides a diagram of the internal workings of the parking lot bioswale in front of you for reference during the following explanation.  
<p>The vegetation in the bioswale filters out pollutants from the runoff, slows down the stormwater’s flow, and allows the water to seep into the specially-engineered soil rather than rush into Gray Stormwater Infrastructure drains. This process not only reduces the burden on the stormwater system, but also improves the quality of water that reaches the groundwater table.  
<p>During the heaviest rains, the stormwater rises above the metal grate inlet and drains through a perforated pipe that reduces the water flow and directs the remaining overflow safely into the stormwater sewer system. Images #4 and #5 in the Stop #2 carousel provide close-up photographs of this grate. Is there any stormwater in the grate right now?
<p>Choosing the right plants is key to the bioswale's performance, and they must be suited to the site's specific light and soil moisture conditions. Plants can be a mix of perennials and grasses, such as the Little Bluestem and Sedges shown in Image #6 and #7 of the Stop #2 carousel. These grasses are native to this region of Wisconsin, and such native vegetation can be arranged within a bioswale to thrive in both sunny and shaded areas as well as typically dry and wet areas. Alternatively, bioswales can be mulched or xeriscaped with rocks and soil only, providing flexibility in design while still incorporating Green Stormwater Infrastructure into urban spaces.
<p>Imagine if every city embraced planter boxes and bioswales in public spaces like shopping malls, schools, and offices. How might our cities look and feel differently? Could you see this happening in your own neighborhood?
<p>Now, let’s head back to the sidewalk on Oakland Avenue. With the parking lot behind you, turn left to face north and walk along Oakland Avenue. Stop #3 is only 200 feet away, so be careful not to miss it!

6,"3","Stop 3: Shorewood High Urban Garden & Urban Farm","03.0_UrbanGardenUrbanFarm.mp3",43.087843,-87.887868,"<p><br>Stop #3 of the tour is on the south side of the Barbara Gensler Theatre for the Dramatic Arts at Shorewood High School. You will need to turn left and walk up a public driveway for the high school, the first driveway you reach on Oakland Avenue from Stop #2. Image #1 of the Stop #3 carousel shows the start of the Shorewood High School driveway.
<p>Local students caretake two distinct practices of Green Stormwater Infrastructure on this section of Shorewood High School. You first will reach an <b>urban garden</b> consisting of native vegetation. The urban garden is marked by a sign that reads “Schoolyard Habitat”. Image #2 and #3 of the Stop #3 carousel shows the Shorewood High urban garden and “Schoolyard Habitat” sign, respectively. Just beyond the urban garden is the Shorewood High School <b>urban farm</b>, but let’s look at the urban garden first.
<p>According to the Green Values Calculator developed by the Center for Neighborhood Technology in Chicago, urban gardens and urban farms can manage <b>1.5 gallons more  stormwater for every square foot</b> of cultivated land compared to lawns. Combined, the Shorewood High School urban garden and urban farm covers <b>2,750 square feet</b>, allowing it to handle around <b>4,125 gallons</b> of stormwater! A link to the Green Values Calculator is available in the “Menu” tab for you to explore this useful tool more after completing the tour.
<p>You already have learned that Green Stormwater Infrastructure as an alternative to Gray Stormwater Infrastructure has great potential to better regulate flooding and runoff pollution by keeping stormwater on the landscape. However, Gray Stormwater Infrastructure also has an acute cost compared to greener options: <b>habitat destruction</b> for native species. Native species struggle to root into paved concrete and other impervious surfaces, often one objective of pavement. However, Gray Infrastructure also creates barriers in the landscape that prevent species such as plants and their pollinators from intermingling, making it difficult for the ecosystem to thrive as a whole.
<p>The urban garden in front of you consists entirely of native vegetation that naturally thrives in this region of Wisconsin's soil, moisture, and extreme weather conditions. Native vegetation has adapted to these local environmental conditions, and therefore is resistant to most pests and diseases. Native vegetation also has deep root systems, which can reach several feet below the ground, improving soil health, enhancing water infiltration, and maintaining a stable hydrological cycle. Native vegetation requires no irrigation or fertilization, which conserves water and prevents lawn pollutants from entering the waterways. Very impressive!
<p>Beyond managing stormwater, patches of native vegetation are essential for a <b>stable ecosystem</b>. For instance, Image #4 in the Stop #3 carousel shows a purple coneflower. Coneflowers like the purple one here and the yellow one from the Stop #1 StormGUARDen are perennial herbs that can grow up to 2 feet tall and bloom during Summer and sometimes in Fall. Importantly, they are very pollinator-friendly flowers. You might even spot a metallic green sweat bee buzzing around them, as shown in Image #4! In this instance, the coneflower and bee hold a mutually-beneficial, symbiotic relationship. Bees are considered a keystone species because they maintain native vegetation, and therefore the other native animals that live in and feed on this vegetation. Thus, practices of Green Stormwater Infrastructure like planter boxes, bioswales, and urban gardens have the added benefit of preserving native habitat and supporting the local ecosystem!
<p>Walk a few steps past the <b>urban garden</b> and you will find the Shorewood High School <b>urban farm</b> just beyond the fence line. 
<p><b>Urban farming</b> in cities takes many forms, from backyard and rooftop gardens to community gardens maintained by a group of people, each with their own plot. The design of urban farms often includes raised beds to maximize water absorption, once again helping to keep stormwater on the landscape. Importantly, urban gardening functionally repurposes this stormwater to provide fresh, locally grown produce. 
<p>Eating locally-produced food has a number of benefits, including reducing the fossil fuel cost of transporting food long distances, preventing food waste and saving money, and ultimately limiting the amount of fertile habitat that needs to be converted into farmland. Thus, urban farming often is promoted as a <b>sustainable food source</b> in addition to a Green Stormwater Infrastructure practice that is both good for people and the environment. In Images #5 and #6 of the Stop #3 carousel, Shorewood High School students are growing a range of vegetables, including corn, kale, tomatoes, and zucchini. These vegetables then can be donated to a local food bank to relieve undernourishment across Milwaukee County. Such a better option for the community and the environment than another parking lot, right!?
<p>As you walk back, reflect on how these small patches of urban gardens and urban farms can have a big impact on our cities. How can you contribute to creating pockets of native vegetation and sustainable food in your own community? Could you plant native plants or vegetables in your yard, on your rooftop, or on your balcony? Every square foot counts! 
<p>When you are ready, walk back down the driveway to the sidewalk and turn left onto Oakland Avenue. Keep walking until you reach the intersection of Oakland Avenue and Capitol Drive.

7,"0","Continue walking","03.1_Walk.mp3",43.088054,-87.887533,"<p><br>As you keep walking, let's uncover the fascinating history that has shaped stormwater management in this area. Milwaukee County’s journey toward sustainable stormwater management began over a century ago. 
<p>Milwaukee is a unique city in that it is built on the confluence of not two, but three rivers: the Milwaukee River to the north bordering the Village of Shorewood, the Menomonie River to the west passing near the Milwaukee Brewers baseball stadium, and the Kinnickinnic River to the south. The Port of Milwaukee is built at the mouth of this confluence, and thus access to waterways and the St. Lawrence Seaway through Lake Michigan has forever defined Milwaukee and its history. As with many port cities, Milwaukee’s industrialization during the 19th and into the 20th century led to increased pollution in its waterways, threatening public health and the environment. But as concerns grew, so did the resolve to find lasting solutions.   
<p>In 1913, the Sewerage Commission of Milwaukee was established to create a sewage disposal system. Their pioneering work led to the construction of the Jones Island Sewage Plant in 1925. While a triumph in its time, the Jones Island Sewage Plant led to a network of underwater tunnels leading to the facility, laying the literal foundation for Gray Stormwater Infrastructure in Milwaukee County. Pause a moment to look at the map on your screen showing Jones Island and the underground tunnel system. You can return to this overview map of Milwaukee County water utilities under the “Menu” tab throughout the tour to orient yourself to the larger urban area.
<p>But, challenges persisted. Population growth and industrial expansion after World War II increased demands on wastewater treatment and stormwater management. In response, the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District was formed, which today has grown so large across Milwaukee County that just 1 inch of rain over the service area produces a staggering 7.1 billion gallons of water. In 1993, the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District oversaw construction of a 19.4 mile-long Deep Tunnel System buried 300 feet underground. The system siloes stormwater away in a holding tank that otherwise could be used to irrigate the vast areas of urban gardens, urban farms, and other greenspaces throughout Milwaukee County!
<p>Turn left when you reach the intersection of Oakland Avenue and Capitol Drive. Do not cross the street in any direction. Stop #4 is just 50 feet west down Capitol Drive.
",2,14
8,"4","Stop 4: Capitol Drive Biofiltration Structures","04.0_BioinfiltrationStructures.mp3",43.089004,-87.888065,"<p><br>Stop #4 of the tour is on the north side of the Shorewood High School, located on the berm between the sidewalk and the Capitol Drive eastbound street. As you turn left from Oakland Avenue, you will see a cluster of three rectangular structures on the sidewalk, enclosed by black metal railings. Image #1 of the Stop #4 carousel shows a view from the intersection of Oakland Avenue and Capitol Drive while Image #2 shows a profile view of the first of these three features. 
<p>These are called <b>biofiltration structures</b>, a Green Stormwater Practice used to capture stormwater runoff from larger adjacent roadways. Be sure to stay out of the busy Capitol Drive roadway when you view these biofiltration structures!
<p>Biofiltration structures boost the stormwater retention capacity of the adjacent roadway by <b>20% per square foot!</b> The structures you are looking at are approximately <b>250 sq ft</b> altogether, resulting in improved capacity of <b>approximately 5,000%, or 50 times more stormwater</b>, for the eastbound side of the Capitol Drive.
<p>Before these structures were built, stormwater runoff along Capitol Drive would flow directly into Gray Stormwater Infrastructure drains, at times overwhelming the underground sewer system. Untreated stormwater that could not be managed by the drains would flow westward, downhill towards the Milwaukee River that we soon will be visiting. In the heaviest of rains, the sloped pavement of Capitol Drive would turn into a river itself! 
<p>Image #3 of the Stop #4 carousel shows Capitol Drive during a series of severe storms in July 2010. On <b>July 15, 2010</b>, Shorewood received over 3.5 inches of rain in just 9 hours, flooding basements and filling the Gray Stormwater Infrastructure sewer system to capacity. On <b>July 22, 2010</b>, Shorewood received an incredible 8.5 inches of rain in just 8 hours, resulting in devastating flooding that led to an <b>estimated $37 million in damages</b>. With stormwater from the July 22nd event having nowhere to go after the July 15th event, major thoroughfares like Capitol Drive became bottlenecks for discharging water, filling the street with <b>up to 3 feet of flooding</b> that surged towards the Milwaukee River. Can you imagine Capitol Drive in front of you now, instead as Capitol River?
<p>The 2010 floods―as well as the similar flooding in the 1990s―set into motion a new Comprehensive Facility Plan for all of Shorewood as well as the <b>East Capitol Drive Reconstruction Project</b> that specifically impacts your tour from Stop #4 to #7. While the plan did include expansion of Gray Stormwater Infrastructure, an environmental assessment performed by Shorewood showed that complete reliance on independent Gray Stormwater Infrastructure would not be permitted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Instead, a range of Green Stormwater Infrastructure practices were suggested to supplement the storm sewer expansion plan.
<p>The biofiltration structures in front of you were built as part of the East Capitol Drive Reconstruction Project and are designed to intercept stormwater before it enters storm drains. When rainwater flows into these structures, it passes through layers of specially-engineered soils and the deep roots of native plants that filter out pollutants like nitrogen and phosphorus, regulating the stormwater that reaches Shorewood’s Gray Stormwater Infrastructure. Image #4 in the Stop #4 carousel shows this biofiltration structure when filled with runoff from Capitol Drive.
<p>While the 2010 floods were catastrophic for the Village of Shorewood, a silver lining is that the new Green Stormwater Infrastructure improved the <b>aesthetic experience</b> of many of Shorewood’s major thoroughfares like Capitol Drive in front of you and Oakland Avenue from where you just came. Biofiltration structures, like many Green Stormwater Infrastructure practices, include native vegetation that add green space and colorful flowers in the right season. So pretty! The main native plants included in the biofiltration structures in front of you are Buttonbush, Karl Foerster Feather Reed Grass, and Prairie Blazing Star. Use Images #5, #6, and #7 in the Stop #4 carousel to help you identify these native plants.
<p>However, the improved aesthetics are more than just adding pops of color into the community. These biofiltration structures as well as the bioswale you visited on Stop #2 provide a barrier between the pedestrian sidewalk and the busy street. As linear features, biofiltration structures and bioswales reduce light and noise pollution from traffic as well as promote pedestrian safety, making the Village of Shorewood overall more pleasant and walkable. Thus, Green Stormwater Infrastructure practices often present a win-win co-benefit of improved stormwater management and improved urban aesthetic experiences!
<p>Before you continue the tour, take a moment to imagine where the water might have flowed from this location on Capitol Drive during the July 2010 storms. Look at how the street slopes downhill towards the west and think about the path that stormwater takes when it rains. What pathways does stormwater take from places like your home, school, or office? Where does this stormwater ultimately reach a river, lake, or other body of water? This overall drainage basin is called a <b>watershed</b>, as we continue to discuss on our tour.
<p>Now, let’s follow the stormwater and head downhill, westward on Capitol Drive. Stop #5 is about four blocks away, so relax and take in the aesthetic experience of the rebuilt Capitol Drive!

In addition to better managing stormwater, the project aimed to minimize impact and enhance economic opportunities for the community while prioritizing aesthetics, safety, and environmental sustainability. The project also included redesigning the streetscape with the inclusion of a bicycle path, pedestrian benches, and adjacent “pocket” or small parks.

Both species can grow 4 to 5 feet tall during late Summer to early Fall. They have deep root systems and are drought-resistant, making them ideal for Green Stormwater Infrastructure. During late Spring or early Summer, you can see the striking reddish-purple foliage of Switchgrass and the vibrant green blades of Lemongrass, enhancing their aesthetic value and the overall appeal of the area.
<p>These structures continue the Village of Shorewood’s mission of contributing to environmental sustainability. Now, as you walk, keep an eye out for these collective efforts that have been transforming the urban landscape, one raindrop at a time.

<p>Again, Shorewood is bordered by the Milwaukee River and Lake Michigan, making it a prime location for freshwater enthusiasts! But this access comes with risks, as flooding and runoff pollution often disrupt this urban community. The Village of Shorewood’s Comprehensive Facility Plan derived from the 2010 floods was just one in many conversations about Green Stormwater Infrastructure across Milwaukee County. In 2015, the Milwaukee’s Environmental Collaboration Office laid the foundation for the Green Infrastructure Plan for the entire County. Adopted in 2019 after discussions with various stakeholder groups, this plan prioritizes funding for Green Stormwater Infrastructure projects and mandates their inclusion in large developments, including those in the Village of Shorewood.

Image #1 of the Stop #5 carousel shows this group of trees to help you confirm your location. 
<p>While they might seem commonplace, these are not just any ordinary trees! They are called <b>stormwater trees</b> and have a wide canopy and deep root system to capture and store water, moderating flooding and runoff pollution. 
<p>A single tree like this one can manage over <b>300 gallons of stormwater</b>…that is about <b>six bathtubs full of water!</b> Over 400 stormwater trees were planted across Milwaukee County as part of the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District’s <b>“Improving Our Neighborhood One Tree At A Time”</b> project in 2021, with these trees collectively able to absorb more than <b>120,000 gallons of stormwater per storm</b>…enough to fill <b>12 large fire trucks!</b> 
<p>Large Gray Stormwater Infrastructure projects often require digging deep cuts into the ground to bury storm sewers and pipes at effective downhill angles for drainage. Unfortunately, such large excavations sometimes require <b>land clearing of vegetation</b> in that area, including trees that provide natural canopy from sun and storms. Even if saplings are replanted, the overall canopy takes decades to rebound, allowing more rain to reach the pavement, reducing the amount of stormwater captured by tree root systems, and ultimately speeding runoff.
<p>Stormwater trees are <b>hardy and water-tolerant</b> with deep root systems for maximizing water storage. Image #2 of the Stop #5 carousel provides a diagram of the underground workings of a stormwater tree to support the following explanation.
<p>Stormwater trees <b>intercept rainfall</b> with their canopies, allowing a portion of the water to <b>evaporate</b> before it ever reaches the ground. Image #3 of the Stop #5 carousel shows the canopy of a fully mature stormwater tree in Fall. Stormwater trees are surrounded by a cut in the sidewalk, here covered by mulch. The soil beneath the mulch is carefully designed to maximize infiltration, allowing stormwater to reach the deep root system. Stormwater trees then draw water upward from their roots and store water in their branches and leaves. Thus, stormwater trees hold water on the landscape both inside and out! 
<p>However, stormwater trees do not just help with water, they also <b>lower air temperature</b> and <b>improve air quality</b>. Concrete stores heat, creating what is referred to as an <b>urban heat island effect</b> in which dense urban development can be 1-6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the surrounding areas during the day, and as much as 22 degrees Fahrenheit warmer at night as the concrete releases the stored daytime heat! Stormwater trees provide shade for both concrete and pedestrians, making walking more comfortable during the hotter summer months and even preventing overextension of air conditioning that can lead to power failures and extreme heat-related deaths. 
<p>Stormwater trees also act like <b>“carbon sinks”</b>, soaking up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and mitigating the impacts of changing climates. Stormwater trees are particularly important alongside busy thoroughfares that have a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions from heavy traffic. Thinking back to the discussion of aesthetics, stormwater trees even <b>boost property values and enhance safety for pedestrians</b>. Wow, so many incredible benefits from these majestic stormwater trees!
<p>The stormwater trees along Capitol Drive include Honey Locust, Red Maple, and Swamp White Oak. Stormwater trees in Wisconsin also are <b>salt-tolerant</b>, making them ideal for storing snowmelt during the Winter thaw that often includes salt from the adjacent roads. Image #4 of the Stop #5 carousel shows this block after snowstorm in the Winter. 
<p>Take a moment to stand under one of the stormwater trees and imagine how something as simple as a tree can profoundly impact your urban environment. How would your neighborhood benefit from trees like this one? Could you see yourself planting or advocating for more trees in public spaces around your neighborhood? Where would you plant them?

15,"6","Stop 6: Capitol Drive Rain Garden","06.0_RainGarden.mp3",43.088997,-87.895349,"<p><br>Stop #6 of the tour is located just after you walk beneath the bridge on your left side. You should see a small garden-like space nestled into the landscape between the bridge and the paved ramp leading to the Oak Leaf Trail bike and pedestrian path. Image #1 of the Stop #6 carousel shows this location in the Summer to help you confirm your location, although Shorewood typically clears this area by Winter!  
<p>This area functions as a <b>rain garden</b>, a special type of urban garden placed in a low-lying depression to collect stormwater from uphill features, such as roofs, driveways, and lawns, or in this case, the Oak Leaf Trail Bridge overpass.
<p>Rain gardens like this one allow up to <b>30% more water to soak into the ground </b>compared to a typical patch of lawn. Each square foot of a rain garden can hold about <b>6 gallons of water</b>, or about as much as you'd use in a 5-minute shower. So this approximately <b>2000 sq ft garden</b> would handle about <b>12,000 gallons</b> at a time.
<p>The focus of this tour is on stormwater infrastructure, but of course not all Gray or Green Infrastructure is specific to stormwater management. However, all Gray Infrastructure presents problems for stormwater management. Today, the Oak Leaf Trail serves bikers and pedestrians, but originally the bridge you see above the rain garden served a rail line. Regardless of rail or road, such long, linear transportation infrastructure often requires <b>drainage ditches</b> on either side to prevent stormwater flooding that makes it impassable. While protecting the path, drainage ditches funnel stormwater away from the landscape, again treating this water as a waste instead of a resource. During severe storms, stormwater can surge along these drainage ditches, undercutting the rail or road and even causing it to collapse.
<p>Rain gardens repurpose the concept of drainage as <b>irrigation</b>. Rain gardens are strategically placed where water will naturally drain from higher ground into a shallow, often bowl-shaped depression. The rain garden in front of you is quite large, using the bridge overpass much like a wall to reflect stormwater back into the garden. However, you can make a more modest rain garden at your home using the downspout of your roof gutter system. Image #2 in the Stop #6 carousel shows a small backyard rain garden using the gutter downspout and Image #3 provides a diagram of the of the underground workings of a rain garden. The Green Values Calculator typically recommends a depth of about <b>18 inches of specially-engineered soil substrate, with an additional 12 inches of gravel</b> aggregate underneath to optimize water infiltration.
<p>The rain garden in front of you showcases a blend of native and non-native plants, which is common in modern landscaping. Depending on the season, you might be able to spot native Goldenrod and Heavy Metal Switchgrass, which are effective for detoxifying pollutants, or Hydrangeas and Sedum, which are excellent for absorbing excess water in their root zone. You also might find ornamental plants like the purple Catmint, which is widely used in gardens because of its hardiness, ability to attract pollinators, and drought tolerance. Use Images #4, #5, and #6 in the Stop #6 carousel to help you identify these native plants.
<p>Rain gardens are a simple, affordable solution for communities to naturally manage stormwater overflow reaching the concrete streets, sewer drains, and local waterways. 
<p>Because they are <b>self-irrigated</b>, maintenance is lower for rain gardens than traditional landscaping, including grass lawns! Say goodbye to your lawn mower! Like the urban garden you visited in Stop #3, rain gardens also provide important wildlife habitat for keystone pollinators, and therefore support the overall ecosystem. However, rain gardens typically drain within 24 hours, so there is no need to worry about attracting those pesky mosquitoes.
<p>Take a moment to imagine how this rain garden would handle stormwater falling against the bridge overpass. Could you incorporate a small rain garden in your own yard? Perhaps in a drainage ditch next to your driveway, near your roof’s downspout, or even in a small low-lying area. Time to buy a shovel and some native plant seeds!
<p>We you are ready, walk up the ramp towards Oak Leaf Trail, which is located to the right of the rain garden. Continue walking up the slight incline until the path forks at Oak Leaf Trail.

Image #1 in the Stop #7 carousel shows this sign and other markers to confirm your location.
<p.The Oak Leaf Trail is an example of a <b>rail-to-trail</b> conversion of old railroad lines into biking and pedestrian trails. While on the Oak Leaf Trail, make sure to stay alert for bikers!
<p>This stretch of the Oak Leaf Trail, running north to south through Shorewood, is part of a larger network that spans over <b>135 miles</b> across the Milwaukee County. Image #2 of the Stop #7 carousel provides a map of the complete trail system in Milwaukee County. You can return to this map under the “Menu” tab throughout the tour.
<p>Returning to some history, Milwaukee’s strategic position as a port city with access to the St. Lawrence Seaway made it a prime hub for agricultural shipping of crops like corn, wheat, and livestock from across Southeast Wisconsin, as well as daily commuting of people from nearby towns and villages. Thus, as Milwaukee’s downtown was industrializing, it also experienced a growing freight and passenger railroad network to collect agricultural commodities for processing and shipping by boat.
<p>Rail has a range of benefits for the environment over individualized transportation and automotive shipping, as it reduces carbon emissions from fossil fuels and enables lower-cost movement within and between cities. However, rail as Gray Infrastructure does have several limitations, such as the impact of <b>drainage ditches</b> on stormwater management discussed at Stop #6 as well as <b>noise pollution</b>. Both rail and major motorways like nearby Interstate 43 also create <b>urban edges</b> between neighborhoods and communities that limit interaction among people and animals, particularly when built without intention before or during unexpectedly rapid urbanization such as Milwaukee County in the 19th and 20th centuries. These edges <b>reinforce segregation</b> and can make it difficult for some isolated communities to access basic needs such as grocery stores, health clinics, and, relevant to this tour, green spaces including public parks.
<p>Once a railway, Oak Leaf Trail was successfully transformed into a vibrant <b>nature corridor</b> in 1966. Enhanced during the <b>East Capitol Drive Reconstruction Project</b>, the trail now serves as more than just a scenic path. 
<p>This rail-to-trail conversion is a great example of how Green Stormwater Infrastructure can be integrated into broader Green Infrastructure efforts, combining stormwater management with ecological and community benefits. The Oak Leaf Trail comprises native vegetation and permeable surfaces to produce a continuous canopy of green space that can be accessed throughout the city, turning an urban edge into a nature corridor that enables people and animals to mix. Image #3 in the Stop #7 carousel shows the green space visible from your current location and Image #4 shows the covered canopy further down the trail. As such, the Oak Leaf Trail Nature Corridor holds all of the co-benefits of Green Stormwater Infrastructure previously discussed on this tour: the green space promotes water infiltration to reduce flooding and runoff pollution while <b>providing ecosystem habitat, lowering air temperatures, and improving air quality</b>.
<p>The Oak Leaf Trail Nature Corridor also demonstrates additional co-benefits of Green Stormwater Infrastructure: <b>recreation and personal health</b>. The Oak Leaf Trail offers a relaxing green space for residents to enjoy nature. Connecting various parts of Shorewood and Milwaukee, it encourages walking and cycling while promoting environmental awareness. Studies show that exposure to such natural environments can <b>boost mental health, encourage physical activity, and even reduce crime</b>. While the Oak Leaf Trail is one of the primary recreational sites in Shorewood, other smaller-scale Green Stormwater Infrastructure practices also promote physical and mental well-being, such as urban gardening and urban farming. Green Stormwater Infrastructure: Better for the environment, and better for your health!
<p>As you stand at the entrance to the Oak Leaf Trail Nature Corridor, reflect on its dual usage for recreation and environmental sustainability. Consider how such green integrations into public trails bolster the community's resilience to environmental challenges while also enhance their quality of life. Think about the roads you travel daily, like the one you drive to school or the store: how could transforming them or other unused spaces in your community into green corridors improve your environment and your well-being?

The Milwaukee River Watershed is a vital part of the region's hydrological system and includes 500 miles of perennial streams, covers <b>900 square miles</b>, and is home to over <b>1.2 million people</b>.  
<p>As you walk to your next stop, pause a moment to look at the Milwaukee River Watershed map that is part of this white circle narration. You can return to this reference map under the “Menu” tab again as we discuss the Milwaukee River Watershed.
<p>Again, 1 inch of rain over the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District service area results in a staggering 7.1 billion gallons of water! But, it is not just urbanized areas that contribute to stormwater here: the Milwaukee River Watershed includes a mix of agricultural areas upstream and industrial areas downstream, with upstream flooding worsening stormwater issues in Milwaukee County. This combination of agricultural and industrial runoff pollution eventually flows into Lake Michigan through the Port of Milwaukee, affecting both water quality and aquatic life. 
<p>Green Stormwater Infrastructure practices like planter boxes, rain gardens, and stormwater trees play a crucial role in filtering out pollutants before they reach the river, directly contributing to the health of the Milwaukee River Watershed. These local actions, while seemingly small, have a significant cumulative impact on the broader ecosystem when considering the scale of a watershed. For instance, <b>if just 1,000 homes installed a planter box, rain garden, or stormwater tree that each captured 1,000 gallons of runoff annually, this collective action would prevent 1 million gallons of polluted water from entering the Milwaukee River Watershed each year</b>, improving water quality and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the whole region. 
<p>As you complete the remainder of the tour, think about how your individual actions at home accumulate over the scale of an entire watershed.

Pretty impressive view of the river, right!? When you reach the bottom of the stairs, look back at the riverbank. Image #1 in the Stop #8 carousel shows the staircase when vegetation is not too overgrown.
<p>You should see some box-y, cage-like structures called <b>gabions</b> on either side of the staircase. The word gabion comes from the Italian word <b>“gabbione”</b> which literally translates as <b>“big cage”</b> and this is essentially what they are: cage-like enclosures filled with stone or other heavy, weather-resistant material. The gabions may be difficult to see depending on the time of year you are completing the tour, as they are easily hidden by vegetation. 
<p>A gabion can hold up to <b>1,000 pounds of stone per linear foot</b>, effectively stabilizing riverbanks by allowing water to pass through the open stone structures. They can be laid at angles in <b>“mattress” form</b> or, more commonly, stacked incrementally like bricks providing more flexibility than concrete walls. Image #2 in the Stop #8 carousel shows gabions stacked like bricks to create a wall-like feature.  
<p>As discussed earlier, concrete and other Gray Stormwater Infrastructure lead to greater runoff pollution during severe storm events. However, there is a second major issue with runoff not yet discussed on this tour: <b>runoff erosion</b>. Erosion is a natural hydrological process in which moving water gradually wears away a landscape feature, such as a riverbank or shoreline. Unfortunately, a common solution for addressing erosion from Gray Stormwater Infrastructure is to add more Gray Stormwater Infrastructure, such as concrete walls and revetments placed along riverbanks and even at the river bottom. Yikes! This added concrete often is dubiously described as <b>“armor”</b> for a riverbank or shoreline. While concrete and other impervious materials might delay erosion where it is installed, it often leads to greater erosion nearby where the force of runoff is displaced by the Gray Stormwater Infrastructure.
<p>The inability for Gray Stormwater Infrastructure to manage runoff erosion was on full display during the 2010 floods. Several trails along the Milwaukee River were washed away as flood waters incised the riverbanks. A massive sinkhole swallowed an SUV on Oakland Avenue as runoff undercut the paved road. Perhaps most startingly, the entire lake bluff at Atwood Beach collapsed by the end of the July 22nd 8.5 inch rainfall. Images #3 and #4 in the Stop #8 carousel show the sinkhole and Atwood bluff collapse, respectively. These incidents not only underscore the limitations of traditional infrastructure to manage runoff erosion, but also reveal the hidden costs of Gray Stormwater Infrastructure, such as increased erosion downstream, short- and long-term maintenance expenses, and the loss of natural habitats along riverbanks and shorelines.
<p>Green Stormwater Infrastructure first and foremost limits erosion by keeping the majority of stormwater where it lands instead of allowing it to move as runoff. However, for large storm events like the 2010 floods, not all stormwater can be captured on the landscape. In these instances, Green Stormwater Infrastructure promotes permeability. Permeable infrastructure like the gabions allow water to trickle slowly across the landscape, reducing pressure on the riverbanks and shorelines and promoting groundwater recharge to maintain a more natural hydrological cycle.
<p>The gabions were placed here as part of the <b>Milwaukee Riverbank Restoration Project</b> following the 2010 flooding, which included planning for the Milwaukee River Greenway. Find a nearby gabion and examine it up-close. Image #5 provides a detail view of a gabion if the vegetation currently is too high. The gabion “cage” is made of galvanized or stainless steel wire to prevent rusting, and woven much like a chain-link fence to carry the heavy weight of granite or other igneous rock that weather slowly. Their flexibility, strength, low cost, and eco-friendly characteristics make gabions valuable in structural engineering projects for protecting riverbanks, shorelines, and other slopes from erosion. They also blend naturally into the environment, enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the area. 
<p>Soon, you will be walking a section of the Milwaukee River Riparian Trail. Imagine the journey of water, land, and people through time along the river. Consider centuries of footsteps, from Indigenous communities to the industrial boom to modern restoration efforts. How do we honor the people that were here before us and not allow their legacies to erode with the riverbanks? What legacies do we create today, and how will it shape the lives of those who come after us?

The name <b>"Milwaukee"</b> is believed to be derived from an <b>Algonquian</b> word from the <b>"good land"</b> and a <b>Potawatomi</b> word for <b>"gathering place by the waters"</b>. Indigenous tribes such as the <b>Fox, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Odawa, Ojibwe, Oneida, Potawatomi, and Sauk</b> all made Milwaukee their home at some point in the long human history of this place. The trail you currently are walking is believed to be part of the vital footpaths that connected Indigenous communities, following the natural flow of the river. Every step you take on this trail reflects the deep connection between the land and the people who first inhabited it and continue to consider it their ancestral home.
<p>The walking path you are following was restored in the <b>2018 Milwaukee River Riparian Trail Project</b>, which was spearheaded by the <b>Village of Shorewood</b> and co-funded by the <b>Department of Natural Resources</b> and the <b>Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program</b>. The Milwaukee River Riparian Trail Project aimed to re-align, stabilize, and restore <b>2,760 feet of riverside trail</b>, including the boardwalk you soon will reach that crosses a natural wetland. Other improvements included invasive species removal, plant restoration, and addition of access points for fishing. The project also included the limestone staircase you used to access the trail from Capitol Drive and the river terrace lawn area at <b>Hubbard Park</b> you will see before Stop #10.
<p>As you walk along the trail, take note of the native vegetation. The river trail is home to a variety of tree species that naturally serve as stormwater trees, including northern red oak, white oak, and bur oak. Some of these trees are among the oldest in Shorewood, with specimens likely <b>exceeding 150 years of age!</b> These majestic oaks provide more than just shade: they serve as vital components of the local ecosystem, improving stormwater infiltration, stabilizing the slope, and supporting a diverse ecosystem.

24,"9","Stop 9: Stream Gauge","09.0_StreamGauge.mp3",43.086067,-87.893529,"<p><br>Stop #9 of the tour is the <b>wooden boardwalk</b> on the Milwaukee River Riparian Trail. Image #1 in the Stop #9 carousel shows the boardwalk to confirm your location. 
<p>This boardwalk was constructed over a <b>natural wetland</b>, and thus serves as a useful place to discuss how the Milwaukee River water levels fluctuate seasonally and year-to-year and how stream gauges help us understand these fluctuations. 
<p>Image #2 in the Stop #9 carousel provides a chart of the Milwaukee River levels over the past 7 years based on a USGS stream gauge located about one mile north upriver. As you can see, the high was <b>4.2 meters</b> or nearly <b>14 feet</b> in <b>October 2019</b> and the low was <b>1.9 meters</b> or just over <b>6 feet</b> in <b>September 2023</b>.  
<p>The Milwaukee River exhibits both seasonal and year-to-year fluctuations. For instance, in Winter, water levels drop as water is trapped on the landscape as snow and ice. Image #3 in the Stop #9 carousel shows the Milwaukee River is a low stage during late Fall and early Winter. In Spring, a surge from snowmelts and rain brings rapidly increasing water levels, at times leading to <b>flash floods</b>. Image #4 in the Stop #9 carousel shows the Milwaukee River in a high stage for late Spring and early Summer. River levels then tend to decrease again into mid- and late-Summer as hotter temperatures lead to more evaporation and plant transpiration. Thus, there is a <b>natural seasonal fluctuation</b> to the Milwaukee River and other rivers that flow through temperate climates that experience four seasons. 
<p>However, not all fluctuation is natural, as changing climates means more frequent and <b>severe storms</b> as well as more frequent and <b>severe droughts</b>. Regional climate models suggest Wisconsin overall will receive more precipitation in the future, but with more extreme seasonal and year-to-year variability between wet and dry periods. As discussed at Stop #8, Gray Stormwater Infrastructure along riverbanks and shorelines such as concrete walls and revetments often displace erosion elsewhere. Such “armor” when placed along riverbanks presents an additional issue: it accelerates the river flow by straightening or <b>channelizing</b> the river, leading to greater high water extremes causing flooding and erosion as well as greater low water extremes causing unnavigable river sections and <b>sediment buildup</b>.
<p>Green Stormwater Infrastructure like bioswales, urban gardens, and stormwater trees help moderate seasonal and year-to-year fluctuations in groundwater <b>storage</b> and <b>recharge</b>. During Winter’s low flow, Green Stormwater Infrastructure retains water in the frozen landscape, slowly releasing it to support groundwater recharge and river levels during drier periods. In Spring, when snowmelt and rain lead to rapid runoff, Green Stormwater Infrastructure gradually absorbs the surge, easing pressure on the river and preventing excessive flooding that can erode riverbanks downstream. In Summer, as evaporation and plant transpiration lower water levels, Green Stormwater Infrastructure retains moisture in the biomass and soil, releasing it slowly to stabilize flow while vegetation shades the river, reducing water loss. In Fall, as rain decreases, Green Stormwater Infrastructure promotes soil infiltration, recharging groundwater and supporting the river’s base flow through Winter. This seasonal, balanced approach not only protects local areas but also reduces risks for upstream and downstream communities, fostering a sustainable, equitable river ecosystem.
<p>Green Stormwater Infrastructure in urban areas can reduce stormwater peaks by <b>up to 33%</b> with an <b>overall 40% reduction</b> in runoff volume. Green Stormwater Infrastructure also mitigates periods of drought. For instance, <b>rain barrels</b> provide additional resiliency against seasonal and year-to-year fluctuations in low precipitation levels, repurposing stormwater otherwise lost to runoff for practical purposes and easing the demand on municipal water resources during severe droughts. For instance, there are two rain barrels on the <b>Shorewood Department of Public Works</b> grounds located just out of sight uphill from your current location that hold a combined capacity of <b>10,000 gallons</b> that can be filled by just <b>1 inch</b> of rain. The stormwater collected in these tanks is used to maintain public planting throughout the village. Image #5 of the Stop #9 carousel shows the rain barrels at the Department of Public Works, while Image #6 shows a smaller rain barrel that can be installed at your own home! Thus, Green Stormwater Infrastructure promotes resiliency to manage extreme periods of storms and drought, helping to smooth seasonal and year-to-year fluctuations in precipitation and river levels.
<p>Take a moment to assess the current water level of the Milwaukee River. How does the current water level compare to the high and low benchmarks provided in the photos? Now, reflect on your journey so far and consider that all of the stormwater from the places you have visited today eventually flows to this point. How different would the river level be if these Green Stormwater Infrastructure practices did not exist to moderate seasonal and year-to-year fluctuations? Now, think about where the water continues to flow from here and how Green Stormwater Infrastructure also protects the people and places downstream from severe storms and droughts.

You have visited a range of Green Stormwater Infrastructure practices, including: a planter box, a bioswale, an urban garden and urban farm, biofiltration structures, stormwater trees, a rain garden, a nature corridor, gabions, and rain barrels. Oh my! Notice this parking lot also has a bioswale in its center with native vegetation that works like a rain garden. It is all coming together! You also learned along this tour about the many co-benefits that Green Stormwater Infrastructure has for the community and environment, including: flooding and runoff pollution management, habitat preservation and ecosystem support, improved urban aesthetics, cleaner air and lower air temperatures, natural irrigation, recreation and improved physical and mental health, and seasonal and year-to-year resiliency. Green Stormwater Infrastructure, pretty impressive, huh!?
<p>These Green Stormwater Infrastructure practices are alternatives to one of the most common characteristics of urban environments: <b>pavement</b>. By now, you should know that impervious pavement in streets, parking lots, and driveways makes extreme storm events worse by funneling stormwater off the landscape, leading to flooding and all the related problems with Gray Stormwater Infrastructure identified throughout the tour. But, isn’t impervious pavement a necessary evil of urban life? We cannot simply revert everything to green space, right? Luckily, even pavement has a Green Stormwater Infrastructure alternative!
<p>Permeable pavement enables stormwater to infiltrate into the ground while still maintaining practical use of the paved area for driving, biking, and walking. Permeable pavement comes in a variety of forms. <b>Paver stones</b> are brick like objects that can be arranged into a tessellation covering the paved area, with water seeping into the gaps between the pavers. Images #2 and #3 of the Stop #10 carousel shows pictures of the pavers installed in the Hubbard Park parking lot. Some pavers even leave open voids inside the paver, as with the permeable sidewalk you passed just before entering the tunnel. Image #4 of the Stop #10 carousel shows these pavers once again. 
<p>Further, even concrete can be mixed to allow more water infiltration. With<b> permeable concrete</b>, carefully controlled amounts of water and cementitious materials are used to create a thick paste that binds aggregate particles with minimal sand. This results in a substantial void content in the hardened concrete, typically between 15% and 25%. Despite its lower strength compared to conventional concrete, permeable concrete is strong enough for a surprising number of applications, particularly in driveways and parking lots.    
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency and geotechnical engineers nationwide recommend permeable pavers and concrete as <b>one of the Best Management Practices for stormwater runoff</b> on both a regional and local basis. The permeable pavement at Hubbard Park exemplifies these Best Management Practices by capturing stormwater and allowing it to seep into the ground, thereby <b>recharging groundwater</b>. This approach not only manages stormwater effectively but also promotes more efficient land use and reduces overall project costs. Additionally, Hubbard Park is engaged in other green initiatives, such as installing rain barrels, bioswales, and native vegetation, further contributing to sustainable water management and environmental conservation in Shorewood. 
<p>Imagine a city where every drop of rain is embraced, not treated as a threat, but as a resource. Imagine if all these overlooked surfaces—parking lots, sidewalks, and roads—were transformed to work with nature instead of against it. That's the vision behind Green Stormwater Infrastructure: transforming the way our urban landscapes handle water, turning gray spaces into vibrant green oases that benefit both people and the planet.
<p>That is it for our tour folks! Thank you for taking time today to learn about the Green Stormwater Infrastructure practices that have been implemented by the Village of Shorewood. If you are returning to the Shorewood Public Library, a suggested route is provided with some additional white circles that identify how homeowners have implemented many of the Green Stormwater Infrastructure practices we discussed today on a small scale. Feel free to continue to listen to the audio tour, or to take your own path home. 
<p>Regardless, always be on the lookout for Green Stormwater Infrastructure practices and think about what role you can play in bringing these practices into existence, whether at your home, your neighborhood, or throughout your city? As you move towards the end of our tour, identify one small change you could make in your daily life to support a greener, more resilient, and more sustainable community.

As you turn left, notice the private residence at <b>3575 N Morris Blvd</b> just ahead. Pause briefly to look at their driveway leading to the garage. In Green Stormwater Infrastructure terms, this is a <b>permeable driveway</b> - similar to what you saw at Hubbard Park. Each square foot of this ground can hold around <b>1.6 gallons</b> of water. Look at the image on your screen to see the driveway up close.
<p>Now imagine how simple and elegant this solution is for a home or commercial property! If more driveways in your area looked like this, think of the collective impact: thousands of gallons of water seeping into the ground rather than flowing into storm drains. Could a driveway like this work at your home or somewhere in your neighborhood?

You may notice downspouts on homes around here. Some are <b>connected</b>, directing water straight into the storm or <b>combined sewer system (CSS)</b> and sending runoff quickly away from the property. This setup is helpful during heavy storms, especially where infrastructure is designed to handle sudden surges. However, in combined sewer systems, stormwater and wastewater flow together in the same pipes, which can lead to overflows during intense rain. <b>Separate sewer systems (SSS)</b> keep stormwater and wastewater in separate channels, reducing the risk of pollutants reaching rivers during storms. Milwaukee’s combined sewer area is mostly downtown, while areas like Shorewood use separate sewer systems to help limit these overflow risks.
<p>In contrast, <b>disconnected downspouts</b> channel water away from the building and allow it to soak into the surrounding landscape or flow into Green Stormwater Infrastructure features, keeping it out of the sewer system. This simple adjustment can significantly reduce stormwater runoff and lower the risk of sewer overflow during heavy rainfall. Cities like Milwaukee and Shorewood have seen benefits like reduced flooding and increased protection for both homes and waterways.

34,"0","Accessible Stop","A_RainBarrels.mp3",43.086007,-87.892815,"<p><br>The extra accessibility stop is next to a pair of features located at the Shorewood Department of Public Works, whose distinct cream and red bricks are visible from the Oak Leaf Trail during most months of the year. The Department of Public Works includes the Shorewood Water Works and the Shorewood Sewer Utility. Department of Public Works staff also administer contracts for recycling, lawn maintenance, and construction services for Shorewood. Depending on the season, you may be able to see two large gray water tanks if you get close enough to the fence. Image #1 and #2 show close-up pictures of the tanks to help you identify them on the Department of Public Works grounds. 
<p>These features are <b>rain barrels</b>, or containers that directly collect stormwater runoff from a roof through a disconnected downspout.
<p>The two tanks here were installed in 2013 and have a combined capacity of <b>10,000 gallons</b>, which could meet the daily water needs of a typical household for all activities, including cooking and hygiene, for over a year. It only takes <b>1 inch of rainfall</b> to fill both tanks!  
<p>As previously mentioned, Gray Stormwater Infrastructure treats stormwater as a waste and not a resource. In traditional systems, the thousands of gallons stored in these tanks would runoff into the storm drains, flowing through the sewer system into the Milwaukee River and eventually Lake Michigan. Even if the Gray Stormwater Infrastructure can handle the capacity of stormwater for a given event, an opportunity for <b>resiliency</b> is missed. What if this is the last storm for a week, or month, or even a year, such as 2012 when most of Wisconsin was under severe drought conditions due to the combination of below average precipitation and above average temperatures. Remarkably, 2012 set a record for the number of days between snows in Milwaukee: an incredible 288 days! 
<p>Changing climates do not just mean more frequent and <b>severe storms</b>, but also more frequent and <b>severe droughts</b>. Regional climate models suggest Wisconsin overall will receive more precipitation in the future, but with more extreme seasonal and year-to-year fluctuation between wet and dry periods. Image #3 in the Accessibility Stop caurosel provides a chart of the Milwaukee River levels over the past 25 years based on a USGS <b>stream gauge</b> located just downhill towards the Milwaukee River. Shorewood sure was missing those 10,000 gallons in 2012! 
<p>Green Stormwater Infrastructure like bioswales, urban gardens, and stormwater trees help moderate seasonal and year-to-year fluctuations in groundwater <b>storage</b> and <b>recharge</b>. During Winter’s low flow, Green Stormwater Infrastructure retains water in the frozen landscape, slowly releasing it to support groundwater recharge and river levels during drier periods. In Spring, when snowmelt and rain lead to rapid runoff, Green Stormwater Infrastructure gradually absorbs the surge, easing pressure on the river and preventing runoff that can erode riverbanks downstream. In Summer, as evaporation and plant transpiration lower water levels, Green Stormwater Infrastructure retains moisture in the biomass and soil, releasing it slowly to stabilize flow while vegetation shades the river, reducing evaporation loss. In Fall, as rain decreases, Green Stormwater Infrastructure promotes soil infiltration, recharging groundwater and supporting the river’s base flow through Winter. This seasonal, balanced approach not only protects local areas but also reduces risks for upstream and downstream communities, fostering a sustainable, equitable river ecosystem.
<p>Rain barrels provide additional resiliency against seasonal and year-to-year fluctuations in precipitation levels, repurposing stormwater otherwise lost to runoff for practical purposes and easing the demand on municipal water resources during severe droughts. Stormwater collected in the Shorewood Department of Public Works tanks is used to maintain public planting throughout the Village, with minimal costs for collection and distribution. The collected rainwater is naturally <b>soft and sodium-free</b>, which is ideal for landscape irrigation, cooling systems, and fire protection. With appropriate treatment, rain barrels even can provide a safe source of drinking water. 
<p>Image #4 of the Accessibility Stop carousel shows how you can use a rain barrel in your own home, connecting it to your downspout for water collection and fitting a pipe or hose for redistribution in your yard or garden. In Shorewood, several local initiatives such as <b>The Shorewood Waters Project</b> offers workshops and events where residents can learn about rain barrels. For example, the <b>“Go Native - Native Plant and Rain Barrel Workshop”</b> at Hubbard Park Lodge provides attendees with free rain barrels and native seeds to be incorporated into their own homes. Additionally, the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District operates a <b>rain barrel program</b> that helps Shorewood residents acquire rain barrels to collect and utilize rainwater, thereby reducing stormwater runoff and promoting water conservation. Information for these workshops is available under the “Menu” tab.
<p>Do you think it is possible for you to harvest rainwater in your home? Maybe not with a giant tank like those on the Department of Public Works grounds, but imagine how much difference you can make even with a small rain barrel attached to your gutters at home. What are the different ways you could utilize water collected in rain barrels at home?
<p>Continue along the riverside path to the southeast until you reach the right-side exit by the entrance to the Hubbard Park Beer Garden. Once you enter the Beer Garden, turn to left and walk along the fence behind the Shorewood River Club building. Once you pass the building, you will see a tunnel that goes under Oak Leaf Trail on your left. Continue through the tunnel under the trail to emerge at the Hubbard Park Parking Lot.
